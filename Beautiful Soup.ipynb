      "In Nitish Kumar's Resignation, Another Twist in Bihar's Political Tale?Election News | Written by Alok Pandey/Radhika Bordia | Updated: May 18, 2014 08:21 IST  ShareEMAILPRINTCOMMENTSfunction shareOpen(url, width, height) {window.open(url, \"\", \"toolbar=0, status=0, width=\" + width + \", height=\" + height + \"\");}File photo of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish KumarPatna:                             Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's offer to resign -- after taking moral responsibility for the ruling Janata Dal United's pathetic showing in this Lok Sabha election -- took many by surprise. (Nitish Kumar Resigns a Day After Poll Defeat)At a press conference held on Saturday evening, he said, \"I was the leader of my party's campaign. The results are my responsibility and I should very well take it.  Bhai.. hamne toh goodbye kar diya hai, baki jo kisi ko karna hai karein (I have bid my goodbye, now others can do what they want).\" (Nitish Kumar Breaks His Silence, Says 'I Respect the Mandate of the People')But in yet another twist to Bihar's political tale, Mr Kumar clarified that he had not asked for the dissolution of the Bihar assembly, leaving room for a new government to take shape without holding state elections. (Take Responsibility for Party's Defeat in Bihar, Says Nitish)Before their political divorce in 2013, the BJP-JD(U) alliance was ruling Bihar with an absolute majority. Now, his government is in a minority and it has been running for a while with the support of four Congress MLAs in the assembly. Sources say Mr Kumar has resigned in order to save himself and his party from dissent and defection, with many suggesting that the opposition to the Bihar Chief Minister has been increasing by the day within the JD-U, especially after it became clear that the party was losing badly in the Lok Sabha polls.Mr Kumar's resignation also took Bihar's opposition parties by surprise.Till Friday, the Lok Janshakti Party was aggressively demanding Mr Kumar's resignation; when he did actually resign, LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan said, \"We did not ask for his resignation. The elections will be within six months.\" googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });The BJP had dedicated most of its victory celebrations in Patna on Friday to speculating how soon Mr Kumar's government would fall. On Saturday, even though the BJP is just 30-odd MLAs short of the majority mark in the Bihar Assembly, the party refused to get drawn into the numbers game, with most senior BJP leaders suggesting that Mr Kumar will be back soon.  (Nitish Kumar is Fond of Resigning: Sushil Kumar Modi)And for once, Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav shared the BJP's opinion on the issue, claiming that Mr Kumar was indulging in  mere drama.All eyes are now on the Janta Dal (United)'s legislature party meeting on Sunday.According to sources, while Mr Kumar could be re-elected as the leader of the legislature party and asked to continue, another JD - U leader could replace him and take over as Bihar Chief Minister. The party can also ask Mr Kumar to recommend the dissolution of the House, they said. Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.

(Nitish Kumar Resigns a Day After Poll Defeat)At a press conference held on Saturday evening, he said, \"I was the leader of my party's campaign. The results are my responsibility and I should very well take it.  Bhai.. hamne toh goodbye kar diya hai, baki jo kisi ko karna hai karein (I have bid my goodbye, now others can do what they want).\" (Nitish Kumar Breaks His Silence, Says 'I Respect the Mandate of the People')But in yet another twist to Bihar's political tale, Mr Kumar clarified that he had not asked for the dissolution of the Bihar assembly, leaving room for a new government to take shape without holding state elections. (Take Responsibility for Party's Defeat in Bihar, Says Nitish)Before their political divorce in 2013, the BJP-JD(U) alliance was ruling Bihar with an absolute majority. Now, his government is in a minority and it has been running for a while with the support of four Congress MLAs in the assembly. Sources say Mr Kumar has resigned in order to save himself and his party from dissent and defection, with many suggesting that the opposition to the Bihar Chief Minister has been increasing by the day within the JD-U, especially after it became clear that the party was losing badly in the Lok Sabha polls.Mr Kumar's resignation also took Bihar's opposition parties by surprise.Till Friday, the Lok Janshakti Party was aggressively demanding Mr Kumar's resignation; when he did actually resign, LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan said, \"We did not ask for his resignation. The elections will be within six months.\" googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });The BJP had dedicated most of its victory celebrations in Patna on Friday to speculating how soon Mr Kumar's government would fall. On Saturday, even though the BJP is just 30-odd MLAs short of the majority mark in the Bihar Assembly, the party refused to get drawn into the numbers game, with most senior BJP leaders suggesting that Mr Kumar will be back soon.  (Nitish Kumar is Fond of Resigning: Sushil Kumar Modi)And for once, Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav shared the BJP's opinion on the issue, claiming that Mr Kumar was indulging in  mere drama.All eyes are now on the Janta Dal (United)'s legislature party meeting on Sunday.According to sources, while Mr Kumar could be re-elected as the leader of the legislature party and asked to continue, another JD - U leader could replace him and take over as Bihar Chief Minister. The party can also ask Mr Kumar to recommend the dissolution of the House, they said. Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.

(Nitish Kumar Resigns a Day After Poll Defeat)At a press conference held on Saturday evening, he said, \"I was the leader of my party's campaign. The results are my responsibility and I should very well take it.  Bhai.. hamne toh goodbye kar diya hai, baki jo kisi ko karna hai karein (I have bid my goodbye, now others can do what they want).\" (Nitish Kumar Breaks His Silence, Says 'I Respect the Mandate of the People')But in yet another twist to Bihar's political tale, Mr Kumar clarified that he had not asked for the dissolution of the Bihar assembly, leaving room for a new government to take shape without holding state elections. (Take Responsibility for Party's Defeat in Bihar, Says Nitish)Before their political divorce in 2013, the BJP-JD(U) alliance was ruling Bihar with an absolute majority. Now, his government is in a minority and it has been running for a while with the support of four Congress MLAs in the assembly. Sources say Mr Kumar has resigned in order to save himself and his party from dissent and defection, with many suggesting that the opposition to the Bihar Chief Minister has been increasing by the day within the JD-U, especially after it became clear that the party was losing badly in the Lok Sabha polls.Mr Kumar's resignation also took Bihar's opposition parties by surprise.Till Friday, the Lok Janshakti Party was aggressively demanding Mr Kumar's resignation; when he did actually resign, LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan said, \"We did not ask for his resignation. The elections will be within six months.\" googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });The BJP had dedicated most of its victory celebrations in Patna on Friday to speculating how soon Mr Kumar's government would fall. On Saturday, even though the BJP is just 30-odd MLAs short of the majority mark in the Bihar Assembly, the party refused to get drawn into the numbers game, with most senior BJP leaders suggesting that Mr Kumar will be back soon.  (Nitish Kumar is Fond of Resigning: Sushil Kumar Modi)And for once, Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav shared the BJP's opinion on the issue, claiming that Mr Kumar was indulging in  mere drama.All eyes are now on the Janta Dal (United)'s legislature party meeting on Sunday.According to sources, while Mr Kumar could be re-elected as the leader of the legislature party and asked to continue, another JD - U leader could replace him and take over as Bihar Chief Minister. The party can also ask Mr Kumar to recommend the dissolution of the House, they said. Get Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.
